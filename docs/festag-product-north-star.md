# Festag Product North Star

Festag must become its own category: a client-facing Delivery Intelligence
Platform — expanding into an **Operational Intelligence Layer** for modern
organizations (Festag V2), and toward a **self-learning Operational
Intelligence System** (Adaptive Intelligence / Company Brain).

For the Adaptive Intelligence architect model (OKM, Operational DNA, predictive
loop), see `docs/festag-adaptive-intelligence.md`.

More specifically, Festag is a white-labelable AI project clarity and delivery
control system for agencies, software teams, web studios, freelancers,
consultants, and project-based businesses.

Festag does not replace the tools where teams already work. It sits above them
and turns scattered internal work into clear, client-ready project
understanding — and, at portfolio level, into executive-ready operational
intelligence (progress, issues, decisions, risks, forecast).

## Festag V2 — Operational Intelligence

Festag V2 extends the delivery layer without changing the core promise:

- **Connectors** ingest signals from GitHub, Linear, Jira, Slack (Notion later).
- **Issues** are a first-class operational entity — distinct from Festag tasks.
- **Objectives** (`/objectives`) link work to strategic goals — Tagro uses them for *why*.
- **Activity Intelligence** unifies work signals, issues, and legacy events on `/activity`.
- **Executive** (`/executive`) aggregates portfolio health for CEOs and founders.
- **Tagro** interprets raw signals into calm, decision-ready language.

See `docs/festag-v2-operating-model.md` for the full organization model, role
portals, daily workflows, and Tagro operating principles.

For the **Leqra intelligence core + Festag execution layer** and how Delivery,
Teams, and Agency modes map to that stack, see
`docs/leqra-festag-operating-architecture.md`.

Festag still does not become a generic PM tool, chat app, or workspace clone.

## Category

Slack is where teams talk about work.

Notion is where teams document and organize work.

Jira, Linear, Monday, ClickUp, and Asana are where teams manage tasks.

GitHub is where developers ship code.

Figma is where designers work on product and visual systems.

Festag is where clients, CEOs, founders, and project owners understand what is
actually happening.

Festag does not compete with these tools. Festag makes their output
client-ready.

## Positioning Lines

- Festag does not replace Slack or Notion. Festag turns their chaos into
  client-ready clarity.
- Notion organizes what teams write. Slack captures what teams say. Festag
  explains what teams deliver.
- Notion is a workspace you customize. Festag is a delivery experience you
  sell.
- Festag turns project delivery into a clear client experience - under our
  brand or yours.
- Notion shows what was documented. Festag shows what is actually happening.
- Notion helps teams write work down. Festag helps companies understand work.
- Notion is a digital workspace. Festag is a control and understanding system
  for running work.

## Real Problem

Project teams are usually working, but clients often do not understand what is
happening.

The problem is not always lack of work. The problem is lack of understandable
progress.

Clients ask:

- What is actually done?
- What is still open?
- What is blocking the project?
- What needs my decision?
- Are we still on track?
- Why did this take longer?
- What happens next?
- Who is responsible?
- Is this real progress or just activity?

Agencies and software teams lose time, trust, and margin because they
constantly need to explain progress manually.

Festag solves this by becoming the translation and control layer between
execution and understanding.

## What Festag Is

Festag must be:

- A client-facing delivery intelligence layer.
- A project clarity system.
- A white-label AI client portal.
- A branded project status and trust layer.
- A system that turns work signals into status, risks, decisions, approvals,
  and next steps.
- A calm executive briefing layer for clients and decision-makers.
- An operational visibility system, not an employee surveillance system.
- A system that helps agencies productize trust.

## What Festag Is Not

Festag must not become:

- Another Notion, Slack, Monday, ClickUp, Asana, Jira, or Linear.
- Another project management board.
- Another generic AI assistant.
- Another internal workspace.
- A chatbot with tasks around it.
- A documentation tool, wiki, or knowledge base.
- A surveillance, screen monitoring, or employee tracking tool.
- A tool that requires everyone to manually document everything.

## Core Product Logic

Festag takes signals from work and turns them into understandable project truth:

```text
Work Signal -> Meaning -> Action -> Client Translation
```

Examples of work signals:

- Task completed.
- Blocker reported.
- Decision needed.
- Client approval received.
- GitHub pull request opened or merged.
- Figma comment resolved or design updated.
- Slack message indicates risk.
- Client email asks for a change.
- File uploaded.
- Status note submitted.
- Voice note submitted.
- Meeting transcript uploaded.
- Deadline changed.
- Scope changed.
- Bug found.
- Deployment completed.
- Invoice, material, document, or photo proof uploaded.

Everything becomes a Work Signal before it becomes a report, risk, decision,
task, timeline change, or client briefing. This is the key data model principle
that makes Festag extensible.

## Veyra

Veyra is not a chatbot. Veyra is a Project Interpreter.

Veyra's job:

1. Read work signals.
2. Understand what happened.
3. Decide whether it matters.
4. Classify the meaning.
5. Detect risks, blockers, approvals, and missing decisions.
6. Translate internal complexity into calm client language.
7. Generate status reports, briefings, and next actions.
8. Keep the client informed without forcing the team into constant meetings.

For every signal, Veyra must ask:

1. What happened?
2. Is it relevant?
3. What does it mean?
4. Who needs to know?
5. What should happen next?
6. How should this be explained?

Classification should support:

- Progress.
- Blocker.
- Risk.
- Decision needed.
- Approval needed.
- Scope change.
- Quality issue.
- Delay.
- Next step.
- Internal noise.
- Client-relevant update.

Technical language must become calm client language.

Example:

```text
Raw internal update:
API is mostly done, OAuth callback still broken, PR pending review.

Client translation:
The core API work has progressed and is close to completion. One
login-related technical issue still needs review before this part can be
considered ready. No major timeline impact yet.
```

That translation is the core value of Festag.

## Product Layers

### 1. Client Panel

For clients, CEOs, founders, project owners, and decision-makers.

They see:

- Project status.
- Progress.
- Current phase.
- What happened.
- What changed.
- What is blocked.
- Decisions needed.
- Risks.
- Next steps.
- Approvals.
- Weekly briefings.
- Optional audio briefings and transcripts.
- Project timeline.
- Latest delivery summary.
- Calm executive overview.

The client should not see raw Slack chaos, messy Notion pages, technical Jira
noise, or GitHub complexity by default. They see translated project truth.

### 2. Execution Panel

The Execution Panel is for the people executing work:

- Developers.
- Designers.
- Marketers.
- Freelancers.
- Project managers.
- Consultants.
- Later: field workers, event teams, construction teams, operations teams.

The interface should adapt by work type. MVP work types:

- Software and web/app development.
- Design and marketing.
- General project.

Execution users should be able to:

- Submit update.
- Mark task done.
- Report blocker.
- Request decision.
- Upload file, screenshot, or image.
- Add voice note.
- Link GitHub PR.
- Link Figma design.
- Add delivery note.
- Request approval.
- Create next task.
- Mark risk.
- Add client-facing comment suggestion.

The interface changes by work type. The intelligence stays the same.

### 3. Veyra Intelligence Layer

Veyra receives:

- Manual updates.
- Execution updates.
- Task changes.
- Comments.
- Approvals.
- Connected tool data.
- Later: GitHub, Figma, Slack, Notion, Linear, Jira, Gmail, Drive, Calendar,
  and meeting transcript signals.

Veyra outputs:

- Client status report.
- Risk summary.
- Decisions needed.
- Next actions.
- Suggested tasks.
- Weekly executive briefing.
- Optional audio briefing and transcript.
- Timeline impact.
- Project health score.
- Internal alerts.

## White Label Strategy

Festag supports two modes:

- Festag Direct: customers use Festag as their project clarity system.
- Festag White Label: agencies, studios, freelancers, and consulting teams give
  clients a branded project portal.

White-label line:

```text
Your brand in front. Festag intelligence underneath.
```

White-label modes:

- Co-branded: visible "Powered by Festag" or "Powered by Veyra AI".
- Subtle branded: agency brand in front, Veyra visible as briefing engine.
- Full white label: no visible Festag brand for clients; higher pricing.

Festag is not selling AI. Festag is selling client trust, reduced status work,
better margin, and a professional delivery experience.

## Product Principles

1. Client clarity over internal flexibility.
2. Translation over documentation.
3. Evidence-based status from work signals.
4. No surveillance language.
5. Calm, premium, precise design.
6. Built for trust.
7. System, not tool.

Use language like:

- Operational visibility.
- Project clarity.
- Delivery intelligence.
- Evidence-based updates.
- Work signals.
- Transparent delivery.

Avoid language like:

- Monitoring employees.
- Tracking workers.
- Watching screens.
- Surveillance.
- Spying.
- Control people.

## Design Direction

Festag should feel calm, premium, precise, and trustworthy.

Reference qualities:

- Stripe-level positioning.
- Linear-level UI discipline.
- Vercel-level developer/product clarity.
- Apple-level emotional simplicity.
- ChatGPT-level calm interaction.

Avoid childish SaaS colors, messy dashboards, heavy enterprise clutter, neon,
purple/green AI cliches, and generic hype.

## MVP Priority

Build the MVP around agencies and software/web teams. Prepare architecture for
more work types, but do not start with every industry.

Priority:

1. Organizations and roles.
2. Projects.
3. Work Signals.
4. Tasks.
5. Decisions.
6. Risks.
7. Veyra report generator.
8. Client Panel.
9. Execution Panel.
10. White-label settings.
11. Agency dashboard.
12. Report approval workflow.
13. Email and client sharing.
14. Later integrations.

Reports should be editable before publishing. Do not auto-send risky AI content
without review in the MVP.

## Copywriting Direction

Use lines like:

- Your clients do not need another workspace. They need to understand what is
  happening.
- Turn scattered work into client-ready clarity.
- Built for agencies that want every project to feel under control.
- The delivery layer between your team and your client.
- Less chasing. More trust.
- Make complex work understandable.
- Client-ready project status, generated from the work already happening.
- Your brand in front. Festag intelligence underneath.
- Not another workspace. A delivery intelligence layer.
- Festag makes internal work understandable for external stakeholders.
- Give every client the feeling that their project is under control.

Avoid:

- All-in-one workspace.
- Replace Notion.
- Replace Slack.
- AI agent for everything.
- Project management tool.
- Employee monitoring.
- Screen tracking.
- Surveillance.
- Better task lists.
- Knowledge base.

## Strategic Checklist

When building Festag, always ask:

- Does this help the client understand the project?
- Does this reduce manual status communication?
- Does this create trust?
- Does this help the agency look more professional?
- Does this avoid competing directly with Notion, Slack, Monday, or Linear?
- Does this turn work signals into clear delivery intelligence?

If a feature is just a generic task manager feature, avoid it or keep it
minimal.

If a feature helps translate execution into client trust, prioritize it.

## Ultimate Promise

The team is working. The client is guessing. Festag closes the gap.

Your internal work stays where it is. Festag makes it client-ready.

You always know what is being built, why it is being built, what is blocking it,
and what comes next.

Final one-liner:

```text
Festag turns project delivery into a clear client experience - under our brand
or yours.
```

## Expanded Architecture Direction

Festag should be built as the AI control layer for client projects, not as a
software-only project management app. Software and digital delivery remain the
first high-value use case, but the platform model must support other complex
client work such as agency projects, minijobs, maintenance, consulting,
marketing, construction-like work, and recurring operations.

Product sentence:

```text
Festag is the AI control layer for client projects - turning scattered work,
time, evidence, decisions, risks, and updates into clear operational visibility
for project managers, clients, executives, agencies, and teams.
```

German product sentence:

```text
Festag ist die AI-Kontrollschicht für Kundenprojekte - sie macht aus
verstreuter Arbeit, Zeiten, Nachweisen, Entscheidungen, Risiken und Updates
eine klare operative Übersicht.
```

### Core Control Objects

The platform should converge around these durable objects:

- `Project` with `project_type`, `phase`, `health_score`, `status`,
  `client_id`, owner, target date, and visibility settings.
- `ProjectModule` for enabled modules such as tasks, milestones, decisions,
  risks, evidence, status reports, client portal, time tracking, approvals,
  file uploads, photo evidence, invoices, budget tracking, code tracking,
  deployment tracking, design review, campaign tracking, maintenance logs, and
  handover.
- `ProjectTypeTemplate` for default modules, default fields, default views, and
  type-specific status logic.
- `CustomField` for project-type-specific fields without hardcoding every
  industry into the UI.
- `Task`, `Milestone`, `Decision`, `Risk`, `Blocker`, `Evidence`,
  `StatusReport`, `Briefing`, `Integration`, `ActivityLog`, and `AIInsight`.
- `WorkSession`, `WorkLog`, `Approval`, and `TimeCalculation` for non-software
  execution flows such as minijobs, field work, maintenance, and client
  approvals.

Do not assume every project has developers, GitHub, PRs, deployments, or code.
Assume every project has work, executors, progress, evidence, updates, risks,
decisions, and client-facing clarity.

### Modular Project Types

Initial project types should stay focused:

1. `software_project` / `web_project`
2. `agency_project`
3. `minijob_project` / `work_order`

Long-term types can include design, marketing, construction-like work,
maintenance, hospitality, real estate, consulting, event projects, and custom
projects. Each type activates only the modules it needs, so the interface never
becomes a wall of tabs.

### Execution Panel

The old idea of a pure "Dev Panel" should evolve into a modular Execution
Panel. In software projects the UI can still label parts as developer-oriented,
but internally the product should use more flexible concepts:

- executor / assignee instead of only developer
- execution panel instead of only dev panel
- work session instead of coding session
- evidence instead of commit/proof only
- module configuration instead of software-only hardcoding

Examples:

- Software project: tasks, PR links, bugs, reviews, deployments.
- Minijob/work order: start, end, pause, duration, activity note, evidence,
  approval, time calculation.
- Maintenance/field work: steps, materials, photos, defects, work time,
  handover.
- Marketing project: assets, approvals, campaign status, publication dates,
  results.

### Veyra Rules

Veyra is the intelligence layer, not a generic chatbot. It should be calm,
precise, evidence-backed, and action-oriented.

Veyra should always classify:

- What changed?
- What is done?
- What is blocked?
- What needs a decision?
- What is risky?
- What happens next?
- What evidence supports this?

Good Veyra output is short and useful:

```text
Der Login-Milestone ist gefährdet. Drei Tasks hängen am fehlenden API-Zugang.
Wenn heute keine Entscheidung getroffen wird, verschiebt sich der Meilenstein
voraussichtlich um 3-5 Tage.
```

Avoid hype, emojis, magic language, long filler, and vague AI confidence. Every
important status should have a reason, evidence, impact, and recommended next
action.

### Design System Rules

The interface must stay calm, premium, and systemized:

- Accent color: `#6a738c`.
- No purple, violet, neon blue, cyberpunk gradients, or loud AI colors.
- Dark mode: `#070B12`, `#0A0F18`, `#0B1118`, `#0D141D`, surfaces around
  `#101821`, `#121A24`, and `#151E2A`.
- Border: subtle rgba white/black mixes through design tokens.
- Text: primary `#E8EDF4`, secondary `#9AA4B2`, muted `#6F7A89`.
- Hover states should be quiet and should not jump upward for ordinary controls.
- Modals, cards, buttons, sidebars, tables, popovers, empty states, loading
  states, and report surfaces must share one visual system.
- No cut-off labels, clipped menus, overlapping UI, stray shadows, dead
  buttons, or layout shifts.

### MVP Priority

Keep the first strong version focused:

1. Projects
2. Milestones
3. Decisions
4. Risks
5. Evidence
6. Status reports
7. Veyra summary
8. Project health
9. Client view
10. Clean UI system

Do not let the broader strategy dilute the MVP. The first visible product must
prove one thing: scattered project work becomes clear, evidence-based status,
decisions, risks, and briefings.
